# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is software that allows computer programmers to protect and share code they are working on. This allows them to revert to previous versions of the code as well as allowing many people access to work on the same master code.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is created when any change is made to the master repository and/or source code. Branches allow you to make changes to the original code without permanently altering the code file.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is used when you are done adding or making changes to a branch and want to save it to the original repository. A good commit message explains in simple language what changes were made.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict can occur if two people try to commit changes in the same file.

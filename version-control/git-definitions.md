# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts

* What is version control? Version control is the ability to view all the history of revisions of a repository, and the ability to merge them. 
Why is it useful? If you tryed to merge huge amounts of data manually, it would take an extremely high amount of time and most likely a lot of mistakes would happen
* What is a branch and why would you use one? branches separate your working file from the one you're working on. this helps so that you don't break your code with a mistake.
* What is a commit? Commits send your code to git, if you dont commit you will not have working code, and most likely it will result in a merge conflict when you try to merge the branches. 
What makes a good commit message? A good commit message should be short and to the point, so that you can easily be reminded of what you changed.
* What is a merge conflict? 
Every merge is a conflict, only the unsuccessful merges tell you about the conflict, this happens when you dont commit your files and there are edits to both branches so git doesn't know how to combine the code.

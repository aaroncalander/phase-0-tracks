What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Linux is developed as a group effort by international volunteers on the Internet. Thus, anyone with enough know-how can develop and debug the kernel, port new software, write documentation, and help new users. There is no single organization responsible for developing the system. In order to have code included in the "official" kernel, it must be mailed to Linus Torvalds; he will test it and most-likely include it in the kernel.

Linux is designed with a very open-ended, feature-minded approach. The general rule is that a new version of the kernel will be released roughly every few months.

The entire Linux kernel was written from scratch without code from any proprietary sources. No distribution of Linux is completely bug-free and will require a considerable amount of effort and attention to keep the system running (which is true of any UNIX system).

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a virtual machine that can be purchased as a service by an Internet hosting service. Instead of having a physical server, a VPS doesn't take up any space and allows the user to run a copy of an operating system (Linux, for example) along with any of the software that runs on that operating system.

VPS Advantages

- lower costs
- root access, which gives you more control than with shared hosting
- can be more customized to meet your needs 
- scalable

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

The main reason seems to be to keep your computer secure. If you run programs as the root user, you are opening up your system files to attack from malicious web pages. On the other hand, if you log in to your own user account, this couldn't happen. Thus, you are protected from attacks and bugs by not running programs as the root user.

Learning jQuery 

Plan of Attack

- work for 25 minutes and break for 5 minutes until 2 hours are complete
- start with https://learn.jquery.com/ and cross-reference http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/ for any unclear concepts
- spend first 20-30 minutes getting an idea of what jQuery can be used for and what the syntax looks like
- spend 1 hour doing hands-on learning and playing with code
- take quiz (www.w3schools.com/jquery) at the end of 2 hours to see what I have learned and what I might need to cover more in the future

Reflections on Learning jQuery

- I feel that my plan of attack was pretty good and gave me a quick overview of jQuery although 2 hours didn't feel like a lot as it took awhile to figure out how to download the jQuery files to run code examples. Doing little bits of hands-on coding helped immensely and allowed me to play around a little bit and have fun. The quizzes on W3schools also helped test the little bits I just learned. Taking breaks was also very important as it took a lot of focus.
